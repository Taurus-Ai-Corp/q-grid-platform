## Why GRIDERA

NIST finalized post-quantum cryptography standards (FIPS 203/204/205) in August 2024. The EU AI Act mandates compliance by August 2026. Every organization running TLS, signing code, or managing certificates must migrate — but most have zero visibility into their cryptographic posture.

GRIDERA is the first platform that combines automated PQC vulnerability scanning with blockchain-anchored audit trails and multi-jurisdictional regulatory mapping, giving enterprises a single pane of glass for the quantum migration.

## Key Features

**Automated PQC Scanning** — Scan any domain for quantum-vulnerable cryptography. Our Quantum Readiness Score (QRS) algorithm rates infrastructure across key exchange, signatures, certificates, and cipher suites.

**ML-DSA-65 / ML-KEM-768 Signing** — Every assessment, report, and audit event is signed with NIST-approved post-quantum algorithms using `@noble/post-quantum`. Signatures are verifiable and tamper-evident.

**Hedera HCS Audit Trails** — Immutable compliance records anchored to Hedera Consensus Service. Every assessment, status change, and report generation event gets a verifiable `hedera_tx_id`.

**Multi-Jurisdiction Routing** — Single codebase deployed across geographic cells (NA/EU/IN/UAE/CA), each with jurisdiction-specific regulatory rules: EU AI Act, OSFI B-13, CCCS PQC, RBI DPSC, TDRA.

**Product map** — Canonical CORE/LABS taxonomy (pipe brand `GRIDERA|Verb`): [docs/GRIDERA-PRODUCT-TAXONOMY.md](docs/GRIDERA-PRODUCT-TAXONOMY.md).

**Sovereign AI Reports** — AI-generated compliance reports that can run entirely on-premises via Ollama/vLLM/TensorRT-LLM. Data never leaves your infrastructure.

**Six-Section Assessment Wizard** — Guided compliance assessment covering system classification, data governance, risk management, transparency, human oversight, and technical robustness.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Prerequisites: Node.js >= 20, pnpm >= 9
git clone https://github.com/Taurus-Ai-Corp/GRIDERA.git
cd GRIDERA

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Build all packages and apps (8 tasks)
pnpm build

# Run all tests (124+ tests)
pnpm test

# Start the landing site (dark mode, port 3000)
pnpm --filter landing dev

# Start the compliance platform (light mode, port 3000)
# Requires JWT_SECRET + DATABASE_URL in apps/comply/.env.local (see .env.example)
pnpm --filter comply dev
```

## Packages

| Package | Description | Tests |
|---------|------------|-------|
| `@taurus/pqc-crypto` | ML-DSA-65 signing, ML-KEM-768 key encapsulation, AES-256-GCM encryption | 13 |
| `@taurus/pqc-engine` | SSL/TLS scanner, Quantum Readiness Score (QRS) algorithm | 11 |
| `@taurus/jurisdiction` | Geo-detection (NA/EU/IN/AE), regulatory framework configs | 13 |
| `@taurus/db` | Drizzle ORM schema with 11 tables, Neon PostgreSQL connection | — |
| `@taurus/hedera` | Hedera Consensus Service audit trails, HTS credential management | — |
| `@taurus/ui` | Brand components, Grid Mesh logo, design tokens | — |
| `@taurus/tsconfig` | Shared TypeScript base configurations | — |

## Domains

`grid-era.com` is canonical. `q-grid.net` still serves and is kept during cutover —
regional cells stay there until each is provisioned on the new domain.

| Host | Serves | Status |
|------|--------|--------|
| `grid-era.com` | Landing + Scan | **live** (canonical) |
| `eu.grid-era.com` | Comply — EU cell | **live** |
| `q-grid.net`, `eu.q-grid.net` | Landing, Comply EU | live (retained during cutover) |
| `na` · `in` · `ae` · `ca`**.grid-era.com** | — | **not provisioned** — no DNS |

The public origin is set in one place, `apps/landing/src/lib/site.ts`, and overridable
via `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`. Regional cells are listed separately and deliberately *not*
derived from it, so moving the canonical origin cannot silently produce dead regional
links. `pnpm lint:brand` fails the build if source links an unprovisioned cell.

## Regulatory Coverage

| Jurisdiction | Region | Frameworks | Deployment |
|-------------|--------|-----------|-----------|
| European Union | `eu` | EU AI Act, GDPR, DORA, eIDAS 2.0 | eu.grid-era.com |
| North America | `na` | OSFI B-13, PIPEDA, CCCS PQC, NIST CSF | na.q-grid.net |
| India | `in` | RBI DPSC, IT Act, DPDPA 2023 | in.q-grid.net |
| UAE | `ae` | TDRA, NESA, ADGM | ae.q-grid.net |

### Enterprise Features

**Sovereign AI Deployment** — Run the entire platform on your own infrastructure. AI report generation via self-hosted Nemotron, Mistral, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint. Zero data egress.

**Org roles + future SSO** — First-party JWT auth today (Neon-resident). Enterprise SAML/OIDC and SCIM are planned via self-hosted Better Auth / BoxyHQ when a design partner requires them — **not** a third-party IdP like Clerk.

**CycloneDX CBOM Generation** — Automated Cryptographic Bill of Materials from your codebase. Integrates with GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket for continuous crypto inventory.

**Regulatory Submission Pipeline** — One-click submission to EU AI Database, OSFI reporting portal, and RBI compliance registry.
