              The sudden push isn&rsquo;t because quantum computers are breaking RSA tomorrow. It&rsquo;s because
              migrating encryption across global infrastructure takes years and the people who actually know the

              That Reddit comment, buried in a thread about NIST post-quantum standards, is the most accurate summary
              of the situation I&rsquo;ve found anywhere. Not from a whitepaper. Not from a vendor pitch. From an
              anonymous engineer who apparently works close enough to the problem to know the math doesn&rsquo;t work
              out.

            <P>
              I&rsquo;ve spent the last six months talking to security engineers, reading regulatory filings, and
              scanning every PQC migration thread on Reddit, LinkedIn, and X. The pattern is unmistakable: the people
              closest to the problem are moving fast. Everyone else is waiting for someone to tell them it&rsquo;s
              urgent. This article is that signal.

            <P>
              Forget the vague &ldquo;quantum computers will break encryption in 10&ndash;15 years&rdquo; framing. That
              timeline is about when a cryptographically relevant quantum computer arrives. The compliance deadlines are
              already here.
            </P>

            <Deadline label="NIST PQC Standards" date="Finalized August 13, 2024">
              FIPS 203 (ML-KEM) and FIPS 204 (ML-DSA) are no longer drafts. They&rsquo;re standards. Every federal

              for every defense contractor, intelligence community vendor, and critical infrastructure operator in the
              United States.

            <Deadline label="EU AI Act" date="Enforcement August 2, 2026">
              The first wave of EU AI Act enforcement begins in 16 months. For enterprises deploying AI in financial
              services, healthcare, or critical infrastructure, compliance requires demonstrable security guarantees

            <P>
              The common misconception is that PQC migration means swapping <Mono>RSA-2048</Mono> for{' '}
              <Mono>ML-KEM-768</Mono> in your TLS config and calling it done. Anyone who has actually attempted this at

            <Blockquote>
              The larger PQC session tickets (4KB vs 400 bytes) were causing issues with some load balancers.
              HAProxy silently truncated them, which led to intermittent handshake failures that took weeks to debug.

              That&rsquo;s not a theoretical concern. That&rsquo;s a production incident report. PQC key sizes are
              10&times; larger than their classical counterparts. When you push those through load balancers,
              certificate chains, HSMs, and API gateways designed for 400-byte handshakes, things break silently. No
              error logs. No alerts. Just intermittent failures that take weeks to trace.

                You can&rsquo;t migrate what you can&rsquo;t see. Quantum Xchange called this{' '}
                &ldquo;the largest cryptographic transition in the history of computing&rdquo; and their first
                recommendation is the same as CISA&rsquo;s: find every cryptographic implementation across your stack.
                TLS certificates, key stores, API authentication, database encryption, code signing, HSMs, certificate
                chains. All of it. Most enterprises have zero visibility into their cryptographic estate.

                Not all systems need PQC on day one. James Collins, a PQC migration advisor, laid out the math on

              <Step number={4} title="Immutable Audit Trail">
                Compliance isn&rsquo;t a checkbox. It&rsquo;s evidence. Every migration decision, every algorithm swap,
                every risk assessment needs a tamper-proof record that regulators can verify independently. Audit logs
                in a database can be edited. Audit logs anchored to a distributed ledger cannot. When an auditor asks
                &ldquo;prove you were compliant on this date,&rdquo; you need a receipt, not a screenshot.

            </div>

            <P>
              Across these four steps, we&rsquo;ve developed the concept of a <strong>Quantum Risk Score
              (QRS)</strong>&thinsp;&mdash;&thinsp;a standardized, composite metric that weighs your cryptographic
              inventory coverage, migration progress against deadline timelines, algorithm agility posture, and audit
              trail integrity. Think of it as a credit score for quantum readiness. One number that tells your board,
              your auditors, and your regulators exactly where you stand.
            </P>

            <H2>We Built This Because Nobody Else Would</H2>

            <P>
              Q-Grid Comply exists because we sat in the gap between those Reddit threads and those regulatory
              deadlines and realized nobody was building the connective tissue. PQC vendors ship algorithms.
              Compliance tools ship checklists. Neither ships a platform that takes an enterprise from cryptographic
              discovery through migration execution to blockchain-anchored compliance proof.
            </P>

            <P>
              We built that platform. It runs on Hedera for tamper-proof audit trails. It implements{' '}
              <Mono>ML-KEM-768</Mono> and <Mono>ML-DSA-65</Mono> (NIST FIPS 203/204). It scores your quantum
              readiness and generates the compliance artifacts you&rsquo;ll need for CNSA 2.0, DORA, the EU AI Act,
              and SWIFT 2027.
            </P>

            <P>
              Forty-five minutes to your first assessment. Not months. Not a consulting engagement. Not a
              &ldquo;Center of Excellence&rdquo; that delivers a PDF in Q3.
            </P>

            <P>
              The deadlines don&rsquo;t wait. Neither should you.
